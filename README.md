# Dither Guy 
Dither Guy is inspired by the Dither Boy software, used to create graphic dithering effects, similar to old screens.


Is a simple Python script that converts images to dithered images.  It uses the Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm to convert images to dithered images. The script is written in Python and uses the Pillow library to work with images.

## Input x Output
<img src="input_images/skull.png" alt="Texto alternativo" width="300" height="200">
<img src="output/skull.png" alt="Texto alternativo" width="300" height="200">

## How to use
To use the script, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You also need to install the Pillow library. You can install the Pillow library using the following command:

pip install Pillow
```

After installing the Pillow library, you can run the script using the following command:
